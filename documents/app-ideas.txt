ISSUE:
TEST Make sure display all sort by distance by default -- just add orderBy=distance

need: have URL to result page so we can SHARE

Get rid of some CSS id and do class instead, like content

IDEA
entertainement, have fun in shibuya: rehearsal studio, cinema, arcade, game center, VR, love hotels, karaoke
J'aime le sentiment de fantaisie du lobby, mais l'équipement sonore essentiel n'est pas très bon. Bien qu'il soit moins cher que Noah, il est un peu cher comparé à Gateway et penta.
Studio Familia Shibuya

NEXT UP

Architecture:
- Analytics: Google Analytics
- Enhancement: register domainname in CloudFlare OR Fastly
