When I was a kid I learnt God has a name by watching Indiana Jones and the last crusade.
Towards the end of the movie, when his father is about to die, Indy must know the name of god to avoid falling into some spiked bottomed abyss of doom.
I remember that, even as a kid, my first reaction, was "wait what? God has a name? What for?" before quickly forgetting about it and follow indy in his adventure. But even as a kid this detailed pulled me out of my focus on the story as my young nonsense-detector was falshing saying "names has been created relatively late in human history solely in order to differenciate one another. this cant be applied to God.".
But anyway, Indy start walking on J. A letter that does not exist in Latin. Then, just in time, he remembers that in Latin, "Jehovah starts with an i". And me I was like "Geo what now?". Ahaha.
I forgot about it, until recently when I learn about God related stuff. Despite it doesnt make sense for it to have a name, God is named YHVH in the old testament. <longStoryShort> Its written in hebrew, so there is no vowel, and so unless someone tells us how it sounds, we cannot guess from just the writing. Later on some dudes came up with a system for how to read hebrew, but still could not make a decision for divine name YHVH, so they decided we shall pronouce it adonai which means Lord and so <longStoryShort>  written in that system, YHVH looks somehow like yehovah <longStoryShort> and some dude centuries later decided Jehovah will be the name in the bible when YHVH appears... the JW decided to change ALL the scripturesm even the latin ones that never ever used any name, to replace The Lord, or God, by Jehovah...  But, all in all, to me, to call God Jehovah and think you can get close to him is about the same as saying a white space in GCC code is calling me Robert and think it can get close to me.


for example:
Orthodox dude: "well, all apostles were atrociously tortured and murdered, but they always preached Jesus had resurected and stuff.... so this is absolute proof the Christ's resurection is true!!"
Me: "errr, no its not".
JW dude: "when your house is infected with cockroaches, you must kill them all before you can live again in the clean house you use to have perfect life in, right? so you see, Armageddon is a great thing, rejoice!"
Me: "wtf?!"
Orthodox dude: "if you only know the world through 2 dimensions, you would say it is impossible to join 6 squares into one entity. But we are living in 3 dimensions, and we know that just make the cube. This is how God being 3 persons actually makes perfect sense, and cannot be otherwise!"
Me: "are you for real??"
JW dude: "Hell aint real because, if you study the original scriptures in greek and the historic map of that time, you see that it most likely refer to that place where criminal and plagued body were burnt all day, not some spiritual place out of earth"
Me: "hm, yea might be, interesting. JW wins!!"
